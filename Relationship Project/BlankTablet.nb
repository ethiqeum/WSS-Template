had known Jim slightly in\\nhigh school. In high school Jim was a hero. He \
had tremendous Irish good nature and vitality\\nwith the scrubbed and \
polished look of white chinaware. He seemed to move in a \
continual\\nspotlight. He was a star in basket-ball, captain of the debating \
club, president of the senior class\\nand the glee club and he sang the male \
lead in the annual light operas. He was always running or\\nbounding, never \
just walking. He seemed always at the point of defeating the law of gravity. \
He\\nwas shooting with such velocity through his adolescence that you would \
logically expect him to\\narrive at nothing short of the White House by the \
time he was thirty. But Jim apparently ran into\\nmore interference after his \
graduation from Soldan. His speed had definitely slowed. Six years\\nafter he \
left high school he was holding a job that wasn't much better than \
mine.\\n\\nHe was the only one at the warehouse with whom I was on friendly \
terms. I was valuable to him\\nas someone who could remember his former \
glory, who had seen him win basketball games and\\nthe silver cup in \
debating. He knew of my secret practice of retiring to a cabinet of the \
washroom\\nto work on poems when business was slack in the warehouse. He \
called me Shakespeare. And\\nwhile the other boys in the warehouse regarded \
me with suspicious hostility, Jim took a\\nhumorous attitude toward me. \
Gradually his attitude affected the others, their hostility wore off\\nand \
they also began to smile at me as people smile at an oddly fashioned dog who \
trots across\\ntheir path at some distance.\\nI knew that Jim and Laura had \
known each other at Soldan, and I had heard Laura speak\\nadmiringly of his \
voice. I didn't know if Jim remembered her or not. In high school Laura \
had\\nbeen as unobtrusive as Jim had been astonishing. If he did remember \
Laura, it was not as my\\nsister, for when I asked him to dinner, he grinned \
and said, 'You know, Shakespeare, I never\\nthought of you as having folks !'\
\\nHe was about to discover that I did.\\n\\n\"\>",

That was the spring I had the\\ncraze for jonquils. Jonquils became an \
absolute obsession. Mother said, 'Honey, there's no more\\nroom for \
jonquils.' And still I kept on bringing in more jonquils. Whenever, wherever \
I saw\\nthem, I'd say, \\\"Stop ! Stop! I see jonquils ! I made the young men \
help me gather the jonquils ! It\\nwas a joke, Amanda and her jonquils ! \

certain observations I've made. For instance that clumping you\\nthought was \
so awful in high school. You say that you even dreaded to walk into class. \

longest distance between\\nplaces. Not long after that I was fired for \
writing a poem on the lid of a shoebox.\\nI left Saint Louis. I descended the \
step of this fire-escape for a last time and followed, from then\\non, in my \
father's footsteps, attempting to find in motion what was lost in space - I \
travelled\\naround a great deal. The cities swept about me like dead leaves, \
leaves that were brightly\\ncoloured but tom away from the branches.\\nI \
would have stopped, but I was pursued by something.\\nIt always came upon me \
unawares, taking me altogether by surprise. Perhaps it was a familiar \
bit\\nof music. Perhaps it was only a piece of transparent glass. Perhaps I \
am walking along a street at\\nnight, in some strange city, before I have \
found companions. I pass the lighted window of a shop\\nwhere perfume is \
sold. The window is filled with pieces of coloured glass, tiny \
transparent\\nbottles in delicate colours, like bits of a shattered \
rainbow.\\nThen all at once my sister touches my shoulder. I turn around and \
look into her eyes ...\\nOh, Laura, Laura, I tried to leave you behind me, \
but I am more faithful than I intended to be !\\nI reach for a cigarette, I \
cross the street, I run into the movies or a bar, I buy a drink, I speak \
to\\nthe nearest stranger -anything that can blow your candles out !\\n\\n- \
for nowadays the world is lit by lightning ! Blow out your candles, Laura - \
and so good-bye.\\n\"\>"}], "}"}]], "Output",
